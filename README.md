# image-recognition-nn-from-scratch
We will build our neural network model from scratch using CIFAR10 dataset. Fater building the neural network, we will save it's structure in a json format and also save it's trained weights in h5 file format. We will save the model so that we can reuse it for predictions.

Please note - The CIFAR-10 is a labeled subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 
CIFAR-10 dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
